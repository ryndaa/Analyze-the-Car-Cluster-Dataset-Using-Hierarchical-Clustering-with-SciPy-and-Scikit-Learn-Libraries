Project Outcomes:
- The three types of hierarchical clustering produced distinct results. With single linkage, most data points are concentrated in cluster 0. While average linkage resulted in a more even distribution of data across clusters 0 and 4. In contrast, complete linkage led to a concentration of data points in clusters 1 and 2
